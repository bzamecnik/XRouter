XRouter project
===============

XRouter can integrate various systems communicating via XML messages. It is
a simple, easy-to-use, configurable, light-weight, efficient alternative to
complex enterprise service bus (ESB) solutions. It is well-designed, written
in C# for .NET, thoroughly documented and released as an open-source software.

The XRouter project consists of several subprojects:
- XRouter - light-weight extensible low-level XML router for .NET
  - plus a configuration management GUI and a simple monitoring service
- SchemaTron - Native C# validator of ISO Schematron language
- DaemonNT - Windows service hosting made easy
- ObjectConfigurator - reflection-based configuration utility
- SimpleDiagrammer - interactive visualizer of oriented graphs
